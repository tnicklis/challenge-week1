# Challenge Week 1: Horiseon Website Refactor

## Description 
This project was centered around refactoring provided HTML and CSS fies for accessibility, readibility, and simplicity. I built this project to demonstrate my knowlegde of semantic HTML, CSS elements, and basic Git. The code is now accessible for screen readers. I learned about how to properly comment in the files and how to make code more readable, for example using semantics rather than divs. I am now able to better de-bug code. 

## Installation 
You can view this code by exploring the files on GitHub, or pulling them into VS Code via Git in the CLI.

## Usage
You can use this website to learn more about Horiseon's offerings. You can access it via the deployed GitPages.
